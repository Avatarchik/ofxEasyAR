# ofxEasyAR
a rough trial addon to use EasyAR SDK with openframeworks

EasyAR http://www.easyar.cn is a augmented reality sdk from china, I tried to use it without their Unity Plugin, 
openframeworks http://openframeworks.cc is an opengl based creative coding platform, I thought maybe someone want to play with this AR sdk.
My code is very badly organized, ofxEasyAR class just copy a lot of code from the EasyARSDKSamples andriod "HelloARNative", but I works on windows vs2015 x64 with of_v0.9.3_vs_release. I dont do android or ios test, sorry for that. The example display a animation model on your ID card(if you are an chinese you will have one).
Have fun, guys.
